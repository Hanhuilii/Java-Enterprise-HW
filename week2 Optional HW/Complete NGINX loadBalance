There are five main strategies for NGINX load balancing:

•Polling (default)
Each request is assigned to a different backend server in chronological order and is automatically culled if the backend server goes down.
•weight
Specifies that the polling probability, WEIGHT, is proportional to the access ratio and is used when backend server performance is uneven.
•ip hash
Each request is assigned according to the hash result of the access IP, so that each visitor has fixed access to a backend server, which can solve the session problem.
•FAIR (third party)
Requests are allocated according to the response time of the back-end server, with short response times given priority.
•URL hash (third party)
The request is allocated according to the hash result of the accessed URL, so that each URL is directed to the same back-end server, which is more efficient for caching.
