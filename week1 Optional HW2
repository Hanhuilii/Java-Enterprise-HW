Regarding an icon, there are six ways to implement an icon

Img method

Background method

CSS sprites method

The font method

SVG method

The CSS method

 

1, the method of img

As the name implies, insert the image with the img tag.

Disadvantages: too many images, increase the server request, of course you can use the CDN.

 

2, and the method of background

Place the image in the CSS background tag. The background attribute controls the image's center, tiling, landscape, or vertical adaptation. 
It is better to use the background attribute than the img tag for more complex image processing.

 

3, CSS Sprites

In China, it is generally called Sprite or Spirit Map. 
The idea is to assemble several pictures into a background image, 
and then selectively display a part of the background image to achieve the purpose of displaying different ICONS.

Advantages: Reduced requests.

You can use the online CSS sprites generator to generate, and then copy and paste the location code of each icon.

and type the icon through font selection, which is a little like the special symbol of sogou input method, 
but the size is not easy to adjust, so font-size should be used.

 

5, and the method of SVG
