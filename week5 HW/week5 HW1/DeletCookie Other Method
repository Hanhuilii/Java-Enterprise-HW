Method 1
You can send a Cookie with the same name to the browser, because the browser is based on the name of the Cookie 
(in fact, there are path, domain, do not set the default is the same) to distinguish a Cookie.
if the two cookies sent before and after the same name, the browser will think that is the same Cookie,
Then the later sent Cookie will overwrite the previous sent Cookie, and the later sent Cookie has set MAXAGE to 0,
and the browser will delete the later sent Cookie immediately after receiving it.
