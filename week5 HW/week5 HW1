Java Enterprise Week5 Question1:
(Cookie 1) After accessing /hello-serulet more than once, Welcome back shall be displayed.
Try to delete the cookies of localhost in your browser, see what happens while visiting hello-servlet again.

Method 1
You can send a Cookie with the same name to the browser, because the browser is based on the name of the Cookie 
(in fact, there are path, domain, do not set the default is the same) to distinguish a Cookie.
if the two cookies sent before and after the same name, the browser will think that is the same Cookie,
Then the later sent Cookie will overwrite the previous sent Cookie, and the later sent Cookie has set MAXAGE to 0,
and the browser will delete the later sent Cookie immediately after receiving it.
Method2: Servlet implements Cookei deletion

package com.tsinghua;
 
 
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import java.io.*;
 
public class CookieTest3 extends HttpServlet{
 
 //处理get请求
 
 public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req,HttpServletResponse res){
  
  
  try {
   
 
   res.setContentType("text/html;charset=gbk");
  
   PrintWriter pw=res.getWriter();
  
   //从客户端得到所有cookie信息
   Cookie [] allCookies=req.getCookies();
  
   int i=0;
   //如果allCookies不为空...
   if(allCookies!=null){
   
    //从中取出cookie
    for(i=0;i<allCookies.length;i++){
    
     //依次取出
     Cookie temp=allCookies[i];
    
     if(temp.getName().equals("color")){
      
      //将该cookie删除
      temp.setMaxAge(0);
      pw.println("删除了color这个cookie");
      break;
      
     }
    }  
   
   } 
  
  }
     catch (Exception ex) {
      
      ex.printStackTrace();
     }
 
 }
}
Result of Remove "cookie" :
The welcome back screen is not displayed
ps
After the deletion, all the previously visited addresses and some auto-filled login passwords of the user will be deleted. 
For example, the user has logged in the forum, the user can set the automatic login after opening the webpage,
but if the Cookie is deleted, the user cannot automatically log in, the Cookie stores these information.
