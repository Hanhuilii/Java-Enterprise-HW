step1:
Click the upper-right hamburger stack and select Options > Privacy & Security. 
step2:
Under Cookies and Site Data, click Clear Data > Cookies and Site Data > Clear to remove your entire cookie history.
step3:
Back to Cookies and Site Data, select Manage Data if you want to choose the sites from which to remove cookies. 
Thereâ€™s also a checkbox to Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed. 
But that may be overkill. Under Manage Exceptions, create Exceptions to always (or never) accept cookies from select sites.
