Safari(macOS) (Safari (macOS))

By default, Safari is only taking cookies from sites you visit—not third-party cookies. You can make changes by:
step1
Going to the Safari menu (a gear icon) and selecting Preferences > Privacy and looking under Cookies and website data > Manage Website Data. 
step2
From there, pick the sites whose cookies you crush; click Remove All > Remove Now to kill all cookies.
ps:
If you’d like to manage how Safari handles cookies, look for the option to Block All Cookies on that same Privacy tab.
To manage the cookies Safari will accept, click any site under Cookies and Website data to have Safari ask sites and third parties not to track you. 
Safari may ask on your behalf every time, but it’s up to individual websites whether they’ll comply or not.
